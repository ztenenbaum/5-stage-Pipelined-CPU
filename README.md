# 5-Stage CPU Pipeline

This repository contains a 5-stage CPU pipeline implemented in Verilog:
- IF (Instruction Fetch)
- ID (Instruction Decode)
- EX (Execute)
- MEM (Memory Access)
- WB (Write Back)

Includes:
- Modular Verilog design for each stage
- ALU module
- Testbench with example instructions
- Simulation scripts for Icarus Verilog / GTKWave


IN PROGRESS
